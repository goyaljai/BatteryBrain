Battery Brain is an Android Application which analyses the Userâ€™s Behaviour and Tries to Predict using Supervised machine learning algorithm and Survival Analysis the remaining time that the battery will last. 

It will also show how much the user has to charge the phone in order to achieve the current goal that he can set (whether he is travelling or going to a place where the user cannot charge the phone).
We will make the data for our algorithm by using dumpsys batterystats, battery-historian, our own generating logs for analysing the variable feature sets like Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, 2G/3G/4G, Screen, Battery Temperature,On Call, Latitude, Longitude, Hotspot, Data packets Transfer etc.
